\section{Introduction}
This project implements a video codec system using both intra-frame and inter-frame compression techniques. The implementation focuses on efficient compression while maintaining video quality through predictive coding, motion estimation, and Golomb encoding.

\section{System Architecture}

\subsection{Core Components}
The system consists of four main components:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{BitStream}: Handles bit-level I/O operations for binary file manipulation
    \item \textbf{Golomb Codec}: Implements Golomb-Rice coding for entropy encoding
    \item \textbf{Audio Codec}: Audio compression using predictive and inter-channel coding
    \item \textbf{Image Codec}: Manages image compression using predictive coding
    \item \textbf{Video Codecs}: Implements both intra-frame and inter-frame compression
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Implementation Details}

\subsubsection{BitStream Class}
Provides low-level bit manipulation:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Bit-level read/write operations
    \item Buffer management for efficient I/O
    \item Support for variable-length integer encoding
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Golomb Encoding}
Implements efficient entropy coding:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Parameter 'm' optimization for data characteristics
    \item Support for both signed and unsigned integers
    \item Zigzag encoding for efficient signed number representation
\end{itemize}

\section{Audio Codec}
In audio coding, our objective was to explore various audio compression methods aimed at reducing file size while preserving audio quality. To achieve this, we implemented two key approaches: a polynomial-based algorithm and an inter-channel residual calculation algorithm for lossless compression. For lossy compression, the polynomial algorithm was adapted by incorporating a quantization step.

We chose the polynomial codec because it is simpler to implement. Given time constraints, we were unable to study and implement more complex algorithms, so we opted for a straightforward yet effective approach.

\subsection{Golomb Parameter Optimization}
The optimal Golomb parameter $m$ is estimated using the mean absolute value of residuals.
To do so we:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Calculate the mean absolute value ($\mu$) of residuals
        \item Round that number to the nearest power of 2: $ m = 2^{\left\lceil {\log_2(\mu)} \right\rceil}$
        % \begin{equation}
        %     m = 2^{\left\lceil {\log_2(\mu)} \right\rceil}
        % \end{equation}
    \end{itemize}


\subsection{Results}
% \subsection{Performance Metrics}
We tested two different stereo samples, obtained from the professor's datasets, with the algorithms:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Predictive coding (order 3)}: Uses the last 3 samples of the same channel
    \item \textbf{Inter-channel}: Uses the left channel to predict the samples of the right channel
    \item \textbf{Predictive coding lossy}: Uses the first method, quantizing the residuals    
\end{itemize}

We evaluated the compression based on:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The size of the compressed file generated
        \item Execution/Computation time (encoder + decoder)
        \item The "Signal-to-Noise Ratio"
    \end{itemize}


For the sample "sample02.wav," we obtained the following results. In the case of lossy coding, each residual was quantized to 8 bits:

\end{table}

For the sample "sample01.wav," we obtained the following results. In the case of lossy coding, we also quantized each residual to 8 bits:
% FINISH THIS
\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Predictor order} & \textbf{Method} & \textbf{Compression Ratio} & \textbf{Exec Time} & \textbf{SNR}\\
\hline
3 & Polynomial & 23.6\% & 224 + 422 ms & inf\\ 
3 &Inter-Channel & 14.7\% & 227 + 362 ms & inf\\
3 & Lossy & 73.0\% & 137 + 270 ms & 28.5 dB\\
\hline
1 & Polynomial & 23.6\% & 220 + 392 ms & inf\\
1 & Inter-Channel & 14.7\% & 231 + 383 ms & inf\\

\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Compression Performance Comparison of "sample01.wav"}
\end{table}


As we can see, there is no noticeable compression difference between inter-channel coding and predictive coding in the lossless category, and since we obtained infinite SNR for the lossless codecs, it means that it generated no noise (as it should). There is also no noticeable difference between different predictor orders (number of previous samples to use to predict the next sample).

On the other hand, the lossy codec has a noticeable difference in compression size while also reducing the computation time. The problem is based on the generated noise. The SNR value reveals that there is in fact some noise, but it is not too noticeable, even after using 8 bitrate (half of the original). \\
% As we can see, the lossy audio codec can achieve much higher compression rates without compromising too much the audio quality.



Lastly, we tested a mono-sample ("balafon.wav") using the same parameters as before.
\begin{table}[H]
\centering
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|c|c|c|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Predictor Order}\textbf{Method} & \textbf{Compression Ratio} & \textbf{Exec Time} & \textbf{SNR}\\
\hline
3 & Polynomial & 42.4\% & 108 + 209 ms & inf\\ 
3 & Lossy & 79.3\% & 59 + 145 ms & 23.9 dB\\
\hline
1 & Polynomial & 35.4\% & 108 + 214 ms & inf\\ 
1 & Lossy & 80.2\% & 53 + 139 ms & 23.9 dB\\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Compression Performance Comparison of "balafon.wav"}
\end{table}

The results obtained differ significantly from the stereo samples, which might be due to certain processes the file underwent before being uploaded to the website "https://freesound.org/". Another possible explanation is that the sample values are more "predictable," meaning that they follow a discernible pattern.


\subsection{Comparative Analysis}
Our lossy encoder achieves at best, a 68\% size reduction from the original WAV file without too noticeable audio differences. In contrast, industry-standard codecs like MP3 typically achieve around a 75\% reduction while preserving good audio quality. This difference highlights the efficiency difference between our implementation and well-established, optimized codecs. 

The primary factor driving this difference is the use of advanced techniques in industry-level codecs, such as psychoacoustic models. These models exploit human auditory perception to discard inaudible data, allowing for much higher compression ratios without perceptible quality loss. Integrating such sophisticated approaches is crucial for achieving competitive performance in audio compression.



\subsection{Limitations and Improvements}
Our prediction model currently supports fixed-order linear predictors but lacks adaptive or non-linear capabilities, limiting its effectiveness in modeling complex audio signals. Additionally, the predictor assumes consistent channel separation and strictly linear patterns, which are not guaranteed for all audio inputs.

Golomb coding, while efficient for certain residuals, performs poorly with high-entropy data. Alternative methods like Huffman or arithmetic coding could yield better compression results.

Moreover, the encoded file is vulnerable to error propagation, where a single error can distort the entire signal, significantly degrading sound quality.


\section{Image Codec}
The image codec implements multiple prediction modes to achieve optimal compression:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Spatial Predictors}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Predictor A (West)}: Uses the pixel to the left, optimal for horizontal gradients
        \item \textbf{Predictor B (North)}: Uses the pixel above, best for vertical patterns
        \item \textbf{Predictor C (Northwest)}: Uses the diagonal pixel, effective for diagonal textures
        \item \textbf{JPEG-LS}: Adaptive predictor that combines A, B, and C based on local gradients:
        \begin{equation}
            P(x,y) = \begin{cases}
                min(A,B) & \text{if } C \geq max(A,B) \\
                max(A,B) & \text{if } C \leq min(A,B) \\
                A + B - C & \text{otherwise}
            \end{cases}
        \end{equation}
    \end{itemize}

  
\end{itemize}



where $a$, $b$, and $c$ are the West, North, and Northwest pixels respectively.

\subsection{Golomb Parameter Optimization}
The optimal Golomb parameter $m$ is estimated using the mean absolute value of residuals:

\textbf{Golomb Parameter Optimization}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Dynamic m calculation based on residual statistics
        \item Uses mean absolute value ($\mu$) of residuals:
        \begin{equation}
            m = \left\lceil -\frac{1}{\log_2(\frac{\mu}{\mu+1})} \right\rceil
        \end{equation}
        \item Adapts to local image characteristics
        \item Optimized separately for each color channel
    \end{itemize}


where $\mu$ is the mean absolute residual value. This approach minimizes the expected code length based on the geometric distribution of residuals.

\subsection{Results}
We conducted extensive testing using standard test images, including the Lena image (786,447 bytes). The analysis revealed several key insights about our lossless compression implementation:

    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Video Compression Techniques}
Our video codec implementation consists of three distinct approaches, each building upon the previous one to achieve better compression while maintaining quality.

\section{Intra-Frame Video Codec Implementation}

\subsection{Overview}
The implemented intra-frame video codec provides a robust solution for encoding video frames independently using spatial prediction and Golomb coding. The implementation supports the Y4M video format with various chroma subsampling patterns (4:2:0, 4:2:2, and 4:4:4), converting all inputs to 4:2:0 format during encoding for standardization.

\subsection{Key Features}

\subsubsection{Format Handling}
The codec demonstrates sophisticated format handling capabilities:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Supports multiple input formats (YUV420p, YUV422, YUV444)
    \item Automatic format detection from Y4M headers
    \item Intelligent conversion to YUV420p for standardized processing
    \item Proper dimension validation ensuring compatibility with YUV420p requirements
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Spatial Prediction}
The implementation uses an efficient spatial prediction scheme:
\begin{equation}
    pred(x,y) = \begin{cases}
        128 & \text{if } x = 0 \\
        pixel(x-1,y) & \text{otherwise}
    \end{cases}
\end{equation}

This approach:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Utilizes left-neighbor prediction for efficient spatial redundancy reduction
    \item Handles edge cases by using a default value (128) for the first column
    \item Implements prediction separately for Y, U, and V planes
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Limitations and Future Improvements}
Current limitations and potential enhancements include:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Limited to fixed left-neighbor prediction
    \item No adaptive Golomb parameter selection
    \item Single-threaded implementation
    \item Fixed prediction scheme without mode selection
\end{itemize}

Possible improvements:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Implementation of multiple prediction modes
    \item Adaptive Golomb parameter selection
    \item Parallel processing of frame planes
    \item Enhanced compression through adaptive prediction schemes
\end{itemize}

\section{Inter-Frame Video Coding Implementation}
\subsection{Overview}
The implemented inter-frame video codec follows the requirements specified in Part IV of the project, providing both lossless and lossy compression capabilities. The implementation uses predictive coding techniques with motion compensation and builds upon the BitStream and Golomb coding foundations developed in earlier parts of the project.
\subsection{Key Features}
\subsubsection{Frame Types and Structure}
The codec implements two primary frame types:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{I-frames (Intra-frames):} Encoded independently using spatial prediction
\item \textbf{P-frames (Predicted frames):} Encoded using motion compensation with reference to previous frames
\end{itemize}
The frame structure is controlled by the \texttt{iFrameInterval} parameter, which determines the frequency of I-frames in the encoded sequence.
\subsubsection{Motion Estimation}
The motion estimation algorithm includes several optimizations:
\begin{itemize}
\item Hierarchical search with multiple scales (8, 4, 2, 1)
\item Early termination when SAD (Sum of Absolute Differences) falls below threshold
\item Configurable search range and block size
\item Spiral search pattern for efficient motion vector determination
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Block Mode Decision}
The codec implements sophisticated block mode decision logic:
\begin{equation}
\text{Mode}{\text{block}} = \argmin{mode \in {intra,inter}} (\text{D}{mode} + \lambda \cdot \text{R}{mode})
\end{equation}
Where:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\text{D}{mode}$ represents the distortion for each mode
\item $\text{R}{mode}$ represents the estimated bit rate
\item $\lambda$ is the rate-distortion trade-off factor (set to 0.9)
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection{Advanced Features}
The implementation includes several advanced features:
\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Skip Mode:} For blocks with minimal changes
\begin{itemize}
\item Threshold-based detection (SKIP\_THRESHOLD = 3)
\item Zero motion vector and residual assumption
\end{itemize}
\item \textbf{Multiple Prediction Modes:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Spatial prediction for intra-coding
    \item Temporal prediction with motion compensation
    \item Adaptive mode selection based on block characteristics
\end{itemize}

\item \textbf{Efficient Residual Coding:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Run-length encoding for zero coefficients
    \item Differential coding for motion vectors
    \item Golomb coding for entropy encoding
\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}


\section{Lossy Inter-frame Video Codec}
The implemented lossy inter-frame video codec extends the basic inter-frame codec by introducing quantization of prediction residuals, enabling a trade-off between compression efficiency and video quality. This section describes the key components and mechanisms of the codec.
\subsection{Codec Architecture}
The codec operates on YUV420p format videos and implements both intra-frame (I-frames) and inter-frame (P-frames) coding with the following key features:
\begin{itemize}
\item Configurable I-frame interval for periodic reference frames
\item Block-based motion estimation with adjustable block size and search range
\item Adaptive mode decision between intra and inter prediction
\item Quantization of prediction residuals with separate parameters for luma and chroma
\item Run-length encoding of zero coefficients
\item Differential encoding of motion vectors
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Quantization Mechanism}
The codec implements a straightforward quantization scheme with the following characteristics:
\begin{equation}
Q_{value} = \frac{residual + sign(residual) \cdot QP/2}{QP}
\end{equation}
where $QP$ is the quantization parameter. For chrominance (UV) components, the QP is scaled by a factor of 2.0 to exploit the human visual system's reduced sensitivity to color information:
\begin{equation}
QP_{chroma} = QP_{luma} \cdot 2.0
\end{equation}
\subsection{Motion Estimation}
The motion estimation process employs several optimization techniques:
\begin{itemize}
\item Hierarchical search with multiple scales (8, 4, 2, 1)
\item Early termination when a good match is found (SAD < threshold)
\item Rate-distortion optimization for mode decisions
\item Skip mode for blocks with minimal changes
\end{itemize}
The motion estimation algorithm uses Sum of Absolute Differences (SAD) as the matching criterion:
\begin{equation}
SAD(mv) = \sum_{x,y} |C(x,y) - R(x+mv_x,y+mv_y)|
\end{equation}
where $C$ represents the current block and $R$ the reference frame.
\subsection{Mode Decision}
For each block in P-frames, the codec decides between intra and inter prediction modes based on rate-distortion optimization:
\begin{equation}
J = D + \lambda \cdot R
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{itemize}
\item $J$ is the rate-distortion cost
\item $D$ is the distortion (SAD)
\item $R$ is the estimated bit cost
\item $\lambda$ is the Lagrangian multiplier (set to 0.9)
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Residual Coding}
The quantized residuals are encoded using a combination of techniques:
\begin{itemize}
\item Run-length encoding for zero coefficients
\item Golomb coding for non-zero values
\item Separate encoding of sign and magnitude
\item Maximum zero run length of 1024 for efficient encoding
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Performance Optimization}
Several optimizations are implemented to improve coding efficiency:
\begin{itemize}
\item Skip mode for blocks with minimal changes (threshold = 3)
\item Fast motion search with larger step sizes in initial phases
\item Early termination of motion search (threshold = 256)
\item Differential encoding of motion vectors to reduce bit rate
\end{itemize}

\section{Video Performance Analysis}
\subsection{Experimental Setup}
We conducted extensive compression trials on a test video (akiyo\_cif.y4m) using three distinct compression methodologies: intra-frame, inter-frame, and lossy inter-frame compression. The source material consisted of 300 frames in YUV420p color format, with the original dimensions preserved throughout all compression schemes.

\subsection{Technical Implementation}

\subsubsection{Intra-Frame Compression}
The baseline intra-frame compression approach demonstrated moderate efficiency with the following characteristics:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Achieved a compression ratio of 1.88:1, resulting in 46.81\% storage reduction
    \item Maintained perfect reconstruction quality through independent frame encoding
    \item Required minimal metadata overhead (48 bytes)
    \item Higher storage requirements at 647,042 bits per frame due to the absence of temporal redundancy exploitation
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Inter-Frame Compression}
The inter-frame compression methodology showed significant improvements through temporal redundancy exploitation:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Implemented with 8√ó8 pixel blocks and 8-pixel search range
    \item Utilized strategic I-frame placement with 15-frame intervals (20 I-frames, 280 P-frames)
    \item Achieved 59.75\% space reduction while maintaining lossless quality
    \item Reduced bit rate to 489,674 bits/frame through motion compensation
    \item Slight increase in metadata (55 bytes) to accommodate motion vectors
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Lossy Inter-Frame Compression}
The lossy compression configuration demonstrated the highest compression efficiency:
